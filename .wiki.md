# Project Summary
MGX Demo is an AI-powered software development platform designed to facilitate the transformation of project ideas into fully functional applications through multi-agent collaboration. By utilizing OpenAI's API, the platform simulates roles such as Product Manager, Architect, and Engineer, enabling efficient generation of complete software projects. Key features include real-time progress tracking, cost management, and an interactive user interface, enhancing the overall project management experience.

# Project Module Description
The project consists of several functional modules:
- **Roles**: Defines the roles (Product Manager, Architect, Engineer) that collaborate and perform tasks.
- **Actions**: Implements actions (WritePRD, WriteDesign, WriteCode) that each role can execute.
- **Team Management**: Oversees collaboration between roles and project execution.
- **Project Repository**: Organizes and saves generated project files.
- **Cost Management**: Monitors API usage and adheres to budget limits.
- **Database Management**: Manages user, project, session, and cost records.
